# How do I use this?

if you don't have any level archive you can get the one you like from [LittleBigArchive](https://archive.org/download/LBP-main-community-archive/Little%20Big%20Planet%20Community%20Archive/)

**when you open LittleBigSearch**

1. Press the settings button.

2. Select your Levels archive from the **Browse Archive** button. ex: C:\Users\User\Desktop\LBP2 Levels Archive\PS3\SAVEDATA.

3. Select your destination folder from **Select Destination** button. ex: C:\Users\User\Desktop\RPCS3\dev_hdd0\home\00000001\savedata.

5. Pick any level you want by pressing on the level cell, the app will move the level folder to your destination folder automatically.

6. start LBP and go to your moon, press ***Square*** on any empty spot -> ***import***.

# How can I trust this

This app was originally a command line tool created to find my own LittleBigPlanet 2 levels in LittleBigArchive, as searching through 7000 folders just to locate one level was near impossible. I then decided to develop a graphical user interface to make it more user-friendly and share it with the LBP community.

**But windows defender is telling me this app is dangerous**

The app used to bind the enter key with the search button for added convenience, but Windows Defender mistakenly identified it as a [keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging), which prompted me to remove the binding functionality. This issue should no longer occur, but I am currently struggling to understand Windows Defender/Anti virus alerts. If you encounter a notification saying the app has a virus please post about it in the issues tap and please mention the anti virus you're using. 

Windows will tell you that the app is from an unknown publisher, you can click on "Show more details" and then proceed to "Run anyway" to use the app without any issues. I apologize for any confusion caused by Windows Defender's warnings.
